# Python Interview Guide

Welcome to the **Python Interview Guide**! 🚀

This repository is designed to be a comprehensive, leveled learning path to help you master Python for technical interviews. Whether you are a beginner starting from scratch or an experienced developer looking to brush up on specific concepts, this guide has something for you.

## 📚 Course Structure

The guide is organized into levels, taking you from the basics to advanced topics.

### [Level 1: The Basics](./level_1)
Foundation concepts to get you started with Python programming.
- **Environment Setup**: Python installation and setup.
- **Core Syntax & Concepts**: Variables, Types, Operators.
- **Core Data Structures**: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries.
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals and Loops (If/Else, For/While).
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions.
- **Basic Input & Output**: Console interactions.

### [Level 2: Intermediate Concepts](./level_2)
Moving beyond the basics to write more robust and scalable code.
- **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.
- **Advanced DSA**: Recursion, Sorting, Searching, Complexity Analysis.
- **Modules & Packages**: Imports and namespaces.
- **Error & Exception Handling**: Try/Except blocks, Custom Exceptions.
- **Important Libraries**: Collections, itertools, functools, etc.
- **Working with External Packages**: Pip, Virtual Environments.

### [Level 3: Advanced Topics](./level_3)
Expert-level topics for senior engineering roles.
- **Advanced Language Features**: Decorators, Generators, Context Managers, Metaclasses.
- **Concurrency & Parallelism**: Threading, Multiprocessing, Asyncio.
- **Testing**:
    - Unit Testing (`unittest`, `pytest`).
    - Mocking & Stubs.
    - Test Coverage & Best Practices.

## 🔑 Key Topics
- Python Interview Questions
- Python Data Structures (Lists, Dicts, Sets)
- Python Algorithms
- Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Backward Compatibility & Python 2 vs 3
- Coding Best Practices & PEP 8
- Concurrency (Thread vs Process vs Async)
- Testing & Quality Assurance

## 🚀 How to Use this Guide
1. Start with **Level 1** if you are new to Python.
2. Navigate to each directory to find code examples and explanations.
3. Practice writing the code yourself to reinforce learning.
4. Check out the **Hands-On Examples** within specific sections (e.g., Testing, Asyncio) for runnable projects.
